Distribute Candy
Programming
Greedy Algorithm

 
N children are standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum number of candies you must give?



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105

-109 <= A[i] <= 109




Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer array A representing the rating of children.



Output Format
Return an integer representing the minimum candies to be given.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 5, 2, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 7


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating 2 cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. 
 So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2 + 1 = 3 candies need to be given out.
Explanation 2:

 Candies given = [1, 3, 2, 1]
