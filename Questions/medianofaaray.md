There are two sorted arrays A and B of size m and n respectively.

Find the median of the two sorted arrays ( The median of the array formed by merging both the arrays ).

The overall run time complexity should be O(log (m+n)).

Sample Input

A : [1 4 5]
B : [2 3]

Sample Output

3

    NOTE: IF the number of elements in the merged array is even, then the median is the average of n / 2 th and n/2 + 1th element.
    For example, if the array is [1 2 3 4], the median is (2 + 3) / 2.0 = 2.5

# Solution Approach


# This problem is notoriously hard to implement due to all the corner cases. Most implementations consider odd-lengthed and
# even-lengthed arrays as two different cases and treat them separately. As a matter of fact, with a little mind twist. These two cases 
# can be combined as one, leading to a very simple solution where (almost) no special treatment is needed.

# First, let's see the concept of 'MEDIAN' in a slightly unconventional way. That is:

#    "if we cut the sorted array to two halves of EQUAL LENGTHS, then
#    median is the AVERAGE OF Max(lower_half) and Min(upper_half), i.e. the
#    two numbers immediately next to the cut".

# For example, for [2 3 5 7], we make the cut between 3 and 5:

# [2 3 / 5 7]

# then the median = (3+5)/2. Note that I'll use '/' to represent a cut, and (number / number) to represent a cut made through a number 
# in this article.

# for [2 3 4 5 6], we make the cut right through 4 like this:

# [2 3 (4/4) 5 7]

# Since we split 4 into two halves, we say now both the lower and upper subarray contain 4. This notion also leads to the correct 
# answer: (4 + 4) / 2 = 4;

# For convenience, let's use L to represent the number immediately left to the cut, and R the right counterpart. In [2 3 5 7], for 
# instance, we have L = 3 and R = 5, respectively.

# We observe the index of L and R have the following relationship with the length of the array N:

# N          Index of L / R
  1               0 / 0
  2               0 / 1
  3               1 / 1  
  4               1 / 2      
  5               2 / 2
  6               2 / 3
  7               3 / 3
  8               3 / 4

# It is not hard to conclude that index of L = (N-1)/2, and R is at N/2. Thus, the median can be represented as

# (L + R)/2 = (A[(N-1)/2] + A[N/2])/2

# To get ready for the two array situation, let's add a few imaginary 'positions' (represented as #'s) in between numbers, and treat 
# numbers as 'positions' as well.

# [6 9 13 18]  ->   [# 6 # 9 # 13 # 18 #]    (N = 4)
# position index     0 1 2 3 4 5  6 7  8     (N_Position = 9)
		  
# [6 9 11 13 18]->   [# 6 # 9 # 11 # 13 # 18 #]   (N = 5)
# position index      0 1 2 3 4 5  6 7  8 9 10    (N_Position = 11)

# As you can see, there are always exactly 2*N+1 'positions' regardless of length N. Therefore, the middle cut should always be made on 
# the Nth position (0-based). Since index(L) = (N-1)/2 and index(R) = N/2 in this situation, we can infer that 
# index(L) = (CutPosition-1)/2, index(R) = (CutPosition)/2.

# Now for the two-array case:

# A1: [# 1 # 2 # 3 # 4 # 5 #]    (N1 = 5, N1_positions = 11)

# A2: [# 1 # 1 # 1 # 1 #]     (N2 = 4, N2_positions = 9)

# Similar to the one-array problem, we need to find a cut that divides the two arrays each into two halves such that

#     "any number in the two left halves" <= "any number in the two right
#     halves".

# We can also make the following observationsï¼š

#     There are 2N1 + 2N2 + 2 position altogether. Therefore, there must be exactly N1 + N2 positions on each side of the cut, and 2 
#     positions directly on the cut.

#     Therefore, when we cut at position C2 = K in A2, then the cut position in A1 must be C1 = N1 + N2 - k. For instance, if C2 = 2, 
#     then we must have C1 = 4 + 5 - C2 = 7.

#      [# 1 # 2 # 3 # (4/4) # 5 #]    

#      [# 1 / 1 # 1 # 1 #]   

#     When the cuts are made, we'd have two L's and two R's. They are

#      L1 = A1[(C1-1)/2]; R1 = A1[C1/2];
#      L2 = A2[(C2-1)/2]; R2 = A2[C2/2];

# In the above example,

#     L1 = A1[(7-1)/2] = A1[3] = 4; R1 = A1[7/2] = A1[3] = 4;
#     L2 = A2[(2-1)/2] = A2[0] = 1; R2 = A1[2/2] = A1[1] = 1;

# Now how do we decide if this cut is the cut we want? Because L1, L2 are the greatest numbers on the left halves and R1, R2 are the 
# smallest numbers on the right, we only need

#     L1 <= R1 && L1 <= R2 && L2 <= R1 && L2 <= R2

# to make sure that any number in lower halves <= any number in upper halves. As a matter of fact, since
      
# L1 <= R1 and L2 <= R2 are naturally guaranteed because A1 and A2 are sorted, we only need to make sure:

# L1 <= R2 and L2 <= R1.

# Now we can use simple binary search to find out the result.

#    If we have L1 > R1, it means there are too many large numbers on the left half of A1, then we must move C1 to the left 
#    (i.e. move C2 to the right); 
#    If L2 > R1, then there are too many large numbers on the left half of A2, and we must move C2 to the left.
#    Otherwise, this cut is the right one. 
#    After we find the cut, the medium can be computed as (max(L1, L2) + min(R1, R2)) / 2;
